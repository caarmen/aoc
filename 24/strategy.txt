The operations leading to zXX must be XOR.

Four of them aren't XOR:

% grep z 24/data/data.txt |grep -v XOR   
cdc OR stq -> z21
x12 AND y12 -> z12
jbr AND wcs -> z33
mgw OR bds -> z45

We need to find the right operations for these 4. We must pick from the pool of available XOR operations which aren't already assigned to a zxx:

There are only 47 of them!

% grep XOR 24/data/data.txt|grep -v z|wc -l
      47

So: try all combos of the 4 items with the 47 items.
